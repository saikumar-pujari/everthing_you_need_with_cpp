All this code was crafted by yours truly. At the time, only me and <b>GOD</b> understood its mysteries. 
Now, it’s just <b>GOD</b>—so if you’re lost, congratulations, you’re in divine company.

If you’ve spent hours trying to decipher this masterpiece, don’t worry, you’re not alone. 
Feel free to share how much time you’ve sacrificed h node* del = temp->next; node* del = temp->next;ere, so others can marvel at your devotion (and maybe pray for guidance).

total_time_spent = "8 hours"  # Replace X with the actual number of hours you spent
