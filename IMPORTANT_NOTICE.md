All this code was crafted by yours truly. At the time, only me and God understood its mysteries. 
Now, it’s just God—so if you’re lost, congratulations, you’re in divine company.

If you’ve spent hours trying to decipher this masterpiece, don’t worry, you’re not alone. 
Feel free to share how much time you’ve sacrificed here, so others can marvel at your devotion (and maybe pray for guidance).

total_time_spent = "5 hours"  # Replace X with the actual number of hours you spent
